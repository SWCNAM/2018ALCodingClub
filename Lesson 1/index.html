                    Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known
                    as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.

                    Computer code can be used to create anything that can run on a computer. This can be things like web sites, desktop applications
                    (Microsoft Word, Google Chrome), phone applications, video games, and much more.

                    Programming languages are tools that we can use to create the code (computer instructions) that tell the computer what we
                    want it to do.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Computers work by reading a series of 1s and 0s called binary data. Its really hard for humans to understand
                    1s and 0s, so engineers made programming languages.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A programming language lets us write code that is easy for a human to understand.  The code is then <b>compiled</b> into
                    1s and 0s so that a computer can understand what to do.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There are many different programming languages to choose from
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>C#</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Many more...</li>
                    </ul>
                    Most programming languages accomplish the same goal, but each language will be suited toward certain tasks.  We have to decide
                    what our task is, and which programming language best suits our needs to accomplish that task.

                    For the coding club, we will be using <b>JavaScript</b>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    JavaScript is a language that is primarily used to make interactive web pages.  When you go to any website, there is a good
                    chance that it is using JavaScript to make the page function properly.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We will be writing JavaScript code inside of a .js file, and we can then view the output by going to a web browser and
                    refreshing the page.

                    We will be learning the basic concepts that are found in all programming languages.

                    <br />
                    Lesson plans:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Variables and Outputs</li>
                        <li>Control Flow (if statements)</li>
                        <li>Loops</li>
                        <li>Data Types</li>
                        <li>Functions</li>
                        <li>Objects</li>
                        <li>Events</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each week we will introduce a new programming concept.  We will write code that illustrates some basic examples of the
                    concept and output the results of our code onto the screen.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If there is time after the lesson, we will work on a <b>video game</b> that SWC has written.  The <a href="./../Brick Breaker/index.html" target="_blank">game</a>
                    code is already written.  We will be changing game variables or adding functionality that relates the lesson 
                    we learned that day.
