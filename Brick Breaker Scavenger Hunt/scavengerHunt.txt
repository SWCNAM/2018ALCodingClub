We are going to use Brick Breaker to learn more about programming!

Follow the steps below. Feel free to ask a teacher or other students for help if you get stuck!

---------------------------
Goal 1: Open Brick Breaker
---------------------------
1. Find the Brick Breaker folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. We are going to open the Brick Breaker game in the Chrome browser. The next few steps tell you how to do this.
3. Open the Brick Breaker folder in Explorer (the program that shows you all the files in your computer).
4. Look for the index.html file. Do you see the Chrome icon next to it?
5. Double-click the index.html file. This should open it in your Chrome browser!
6. Answer the questions below!

Questions for Goal 1:

1. What colors are the bricks? (bonus - what does each brick color mean?)
2. How many lives do you start out with?
3. How many points do you get for each brick?

--------------------------------
Goal 2: Find and write comments
--------------------------------
1. In the Brick Breaker folder, find the index.js file.
2. Put your cursor on Line 1 of the file. Press enter twice so that all the code moves down 2 lines.
3. Move your cursor back up to the top of the file.
4. Type [Your Name]'s Brick Breaker Game (ex. Denise's Brick Breaker Game).
5. Hover over the words you just type. Do you see any red squiggly lines?
6. Put your cursor all the way over to the top left of the file (before the first letter of your name).
7. Type '// ' before your name (ex. // Denise's Brick Breaker Game).
8. What happens to the red lines?
9. What happens to the line of text you typed?
10. Find another example of a line of code with '//' in front of it.
    In JavaScript, lines of code starting with '//' are called comments. 
    Where in the file did you find another comment, and what do you think it is there for?

    Write your answers down here:

    1. I found a line of code starting with '//' on Line Number ___.
    2. This is what I think the line of code is there for: _________________________________.

----------------------------
Goal 3: Work with variables
----------------------------
1. The top section of the index.js file has 4 different categories of variables. 
   These control different parts of the game. 
   
   What are the 4 categories? Write them down below.

   1. ____ variables
   2. _______________ variables
   3.
   4. 

2. Find the gameTitle variable. What line number was it on?

   Write the answer down here: Line ____.

3. Change the gameTitle variable.
4. Go back to Chrome and refresh the Brick Breaker tab. 
5. Answer these two questions:
   
   1. What changed when you changed gameTitle?
   2. What does the gameTitle variable store?

6. Change another variable in the first section of the file. Try to figure out what it does, too!
7. When you figure it out, make a comment above that variable to explain what it does.
8. Show a teacher when your comment is complete!
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for three more variables. We will share the ones we chose at the end of the class.

    Write the names of the variables you chose here:

    1. 
    2.
    3.
