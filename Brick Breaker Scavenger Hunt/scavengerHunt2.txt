We are going to use Brick Breaker to learn more about programming!

Follow the steps below. Feel free to ask a teacher or other students for help if you get stuck!

---------------------------
Goal 4: 
---------------------------
1. Open the Brick Breaker JavaScript file.
2. Press the Control key and the F key at the same time to open up a search. 
   You can also open the Edit menu at the top, and click on the Find option.
3. Search for the phrase 'player.lives'.
4. How many results do you find?
5. What do the lines of code for each result seem to be doing?
   Add a comment above each of them with your best guess.
6. In the switch statement, add the following lines above case 0:

    case 9:
        this.showMessage("You're a cat!");
        break;

7. Now, open the Brick Breaker game and play a little bit.
8. What happens after you lose a life? 
   Is it different than what happens after you lose 2 lives?
   What do you think is happening?
9. Add some more of your own cases and messages!
10. Try moving the cases out of order (putting a smaller number before a larger one). What happens?
11. Try not putting 'break;' at the end of some of the cases. What happens?
